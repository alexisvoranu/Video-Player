This project provides users with the ability to watch a collection of movies stored within the application.

Key Features:

  **Playlist Navigation:**
  Users can navigate through the playlist, with the option for automatic transition to the next movie.
  
  **Movie Management:**
  Add new movies to the playlist through drag and drop or using an input control.
  Modify the order of movies in the playlist and delete movies from the playlist.
  
  **Video Effects:**
  Apply user-selectable video effects using a canvas element.
  
  **Canvas-based Controls:**
  Implement video drawing and semi-transparent controls (previous, play/pause, next, progress bar, and volume) on the same canvas element, overlaid on the video stream.
  Determine user actions based on cursor position within the canvas.
  The canvas element is utilized for drawing video and overlaying controls, providing a seamless and interactive movie-watching experience. 
  
  **Preview Frame Functionality:**
  Implement functionality for preview frames when the cursor is over the progress bar.
  
  **Subtitles Display:**
  Display subtitles stored in JSON files within the application.
  Subtitles, playlist management, and user settings add to the overall functionality and customization of the application.
  
  **Settings Persistence:**
  Store user settings (e.g., volume level, current position in the playlist) using the Web Storage API.
